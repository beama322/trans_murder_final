  <b>Worldwide Transgender Murder Count (2008-2014)</b><br><br>
  
This final assignment brought human identity to the surface for me personally. I am recently out (publicly) as genderqueer--this fueled my motivation to research the amount of people who are killed for being themselves. The idea and research turned into my project.<br><br>
  
The highest concentrated murders according to the data provided by the Trans Murder Monitoring Project via <a href="http://www.transrespect-transphobia.org/uploads/downloads/2015/TMM-IDAHOT2015/TvT-TMM-Tables_IDAHOT-2015_EN.pdf">Transrespect-Transphobia</a> are Brazil, Mexico, and the United States of America. The most stunning aspect of this data was the fact that there were approximately 690 documented transgender people who were killed within 2008-2014 in Brazil. Six years seems like a long time, but if you think about it, thatâ€™s about 80 people a year!<br><br>
  
The purpose of this <a href="https://beama322.cartodb.com/viz/31cb0dec-92cb-11e5-b77e-0e3ff518bd15/public_map">interactive map</a> is to provide insight on where transgender murders are a problem on a worldwide scale. In understanding which parts of the world need help moving past injustice, activists and those alike are able to pitch ideas on how to go about fixing social construction in those targeted regions. <br><br>
  
After seeing the interactive in it's "final form", I saw some aspects that could improve its public purpose. Adding a more realistic feature to this map would draw in a wider crowd than only activists. Maybe by embedding images of past cases (if possible) it would bring in a bigger audience -- the images would increase the emotional appeal and humanize the data. I decided to take the map a step further and add a layer, focusing in on Brazil.
